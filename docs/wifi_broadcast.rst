Broadcast RLNC with a WiFi Channel
==================================

.. _wifi_broadcast:

General Topology
----------------

The topology considered describes a transmitter sending coded packets
with RLNC from a generation size :math:`g` and field size :math:`q` in a
broadcast fashion through a 802.11b channel to N receivers. For the
purpose of our example, we will start with :math:`g = 5`, :math:`q = 2`
(i.e. the binary field), :math:`N = 2` and we will check the completion
time in terms of transmissions through the WiFi channel under different
situations. Topology is shown as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/kodo-wifi-broadcast.cc
   :language: c++
   :start-after: //! [0]
   :end-before: //! [1]
   :linenos:

What to Simulate
----------------

We will consider the following guidelines for our simulation:

* Behavior: The sender keeps transmitting the generation until the
  receiver has :math:`g` linearly independent (l.i.) coded packets
  (combinations). Packets might or might not be loss due to channel
  impairments.
* Inputs: As main parameters regarding RLNC, we choose the generation
  and field size. A parameter regarding channel control should be included
* Outputs: A counter to indicate how much transmissions did the process
  required and some prints to indicate when decoding is completed.
* Scenarios: We will variate the generation and field size to verify
  theoretical expected values regarding the amount of transmissions to
  decode. Also, the number of transmissions should somehow change as we
  vary the channel.

Program Description
-------------------

After the project has been properly configured and built, you should have
a folder named ``kodo`` in the examples folder of your local ns-3 repository
(e.g. in ``~/ns-3-dev/examples``). If you check there, you will find two type
of files. First,  the header files are the implementations for the
considered topologies in our examples. You are free to add new
topologies as well. Second, the source files are the actual applications
of those topologies within ns-3. For our case here, we will first review
the broadcast topology contained in ``kodo-broadcast.h`` and its application
in ``kodo-wifi-broadcast.cc``, which contains the source code of this
simulation. You can open them with your preferred editor
to review the source code. We will briefly review some of its parts.

Overview Comments and Includes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. literalinclude:: ../examples/kodo-wifi-broadcast.cc
   :language: c++
   :start-after: //! [2]
   :end-before: //! [3]
   :linenos:

As with any source code, the overview comments provide a reference to the users
regarding project general aspects. The E-macs descriptor is part of the
ns-3 coding style to allow E-macs developers' editor to recognize the document
type. Following, licensing terms and an introduction to what we are simulating
are displayed. Header includes are ordered from most general to particular
functionalities within ns-3 and Kodo. From ns-3, the necessary modules are:

* Core module: For simulation event handling. This module provide a set of
  class-based APIs that control the simulation behavior. It is essential for
  every ns-3 simulation.
* Network module: For creation and management of simulated devices. ns-3 has
  mainly two building blocks which represent a transmission/reception
  interface on physical equipment, namely **nodes** ("equipment") from a
  networking perspective and **net devices** ("interface cards") which actually
  deal with the physical layer. A node may have various net devices, but a net
  device cannot be shared by various nodes. We will also use the ``Packet``
  and ``ErrorModel`` classes from this module to represent other simulation
  objects in the examples.
* Mobility module: For providing a description of how the nodes move in an
  environment. We will use briefly this module for a representation of our
  physical channel.
* Config-store module: A specialized ns-3 database for internal attributes and
  default values for the different APIs.
* WiFi module: A PHY and MAC layer models for WiFi. Necessary for our medium
  access control and channel model.
* Internet module: For handling the IPv4 protocol at the network layer.

Other includes are particular to this implementation and they can be found in
standard C++ code. From Kodo, the header ``kodo-broadcast.h`` contains the
description of the encoder and decoder objects that we use.

Default Namespace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will be working within the ns-3 scope given that most of our objects are from
this library. This is typical across ns-3 code.

.. code-block:: c++

   using namespace ns3;

Simulation Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before starting, we describe the object created in ``kodo-broadcast.h``
with the purpose to represent the RLNC broadcast topology. In this sense, we
represent our Kodo simulation as a class with different functionalities.
Of course, this is purely subjective. You may choose how you represent your
objects in your simulation. Although, we choose this way because it enabled
us to modularize all the simulation into a single object which is controlled
by the network through the tasks of the net devices. Also, other ns-3 objects
can extract information from it in an easy way.

The ``Broadcast`` class can be roughly defined in the following way:

.. code-block:: c++

  #pragma once

  #include <cstdint>
  #include <memory>
  #include <vector>

  #include <kodo_rlnc/coders.hpp>

  class Broadcast
  {
  public:

    Broadcast (const fifi::finite_field field, const uint32_t users,
        const uint32_t generationSize, const uint32_t packetSize,
        const ns3::Ptr<ns3::Socket>& source,
        const std::vector<ns3::Ptr<ns3::Socket>>& sinks)
        : m_field (field),
          m_users (users),
          m_generationSize (generationSize),
          m_packetSize (packetSize),
          m_source (source),
          m_sinks (sinks)
    {
      // Constructor
    }

    void SendPacket (ns3::Ptr<ns3::Socket> socket, ns3::Time pktInterval)
    {
      // Encoder logic
    }

    void ReceivePacket (ns3::Ptr<ns3::Socket> socket)
    {
      // Decoders logic
    }

  private:

    const fifi::finite_field m_field;
    const uint32_t m_users;
    const uint32_t m_generationSize;
    const uint32_t m_packetSize;

    ns3::Ptr<ns3::Socket> m_source;
    std::vector<ns3::Ptr<ns3::Socket>> m_sinks;
    std::shared_ptr<kodo_rlnc::encoder> m_encoder;
    std::vector<uint8_t> m_encoderBuffer;
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<kodo_rlnc::decoder>> m_decoders;
    std::vector<std::vector<uint8_t>> m_decoderBuffers;

    std::vector<uint8_t> m_payload;
    uint32_t m_transmissionCount;
  };

The broadcast topology is a simple class. We will describe its parts in detail
what they model and control from a high level perspective.
First, we include ``<kodo_rlnc/coders.hpp>`` from kodo-rlnc which contains
the encoder and decoder classes that we will use.

Then we create  our encoder and decoders. We select the finite field type,
the generation size and the packet size for our coding operations.

The ``kodo_rlnc::encoder`` wrapper class is defined in the
`kodo-rlnc  <https://github.com/steinwurf/kodo-rlnc>`_ library.
The available finite fields are defined in the
`fifi  <https://github.com/steinwurf/fifi>`_ library.
Other field types might be chosen to fit the needs of your application.
The common field sizes are: :math:`q = {2, 2^4, 2^8}`.

For the simulation, ``void SendPacket(ns3::Ptr<ns3::Socket> socket, ns3::Time
pktInterval)`` generates coded packets from generic data (created in the
constructor) every ``pktInterval`` units of ``Time`` and sends them to the
decoders through their socket connections, represented by the
ns-3 smart pointer object ``ns3::Ptr<ns3::Socket>``.

As we will check later, ``void ReceivePacket(ns3::Ptr<ns3::Socket> socket)``
will be invoked through a callback whenever a packet is received at a
decoder socket. In this case, the decoder that triggered the
callback is obtained from looking into a vector container.
The transmitter creates coded packets from the data and puts them
in a payload buffer that is sent over the socket. A received coded packet is
placed in a temporary payload buffer to be read by the decoder.

You can check the source code to see how these operations are
performed by the APIs ``m_encoder.write_payload()`` and
``m_decoders[n].read_payload()``. For the encoding case, the amount of bytes
needed to store the coded payload is returned. This amount is used for the
``ns3::Create<ns3::Packet>`` constructor to create the ns-3
packet that is actually sent (and received). Finally,
``m_transmission_count`` indicates how many packets were sent by the encoder
during the whole process. You can review the implementation of
``SendPacket`` and ``ReceivePacket`` to see the expected behavior of the
nodes when packets are sent or received respectively.

Default Parameters and Command-line Parsing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/kodo-wifi-broadcast.cc
   :language: c++
   :start-after: //! [4]
   :end-before: //! [5]
   :linenos:

The first part of the ``main`` function defines the default simulation
parameters including the physical layer mode for WiFi (Direct Sequence Spread
Spectrum of 1 Mbps rate), the loss rate margins, the packet
size, the interval between ns-3 events, the generation size, the number of
users (i.e. receivers) and the finite field. After that, we create an instance
of the ``CommandLine`` class which is ns-3's command line parser.
We add the parameters with the ``AddValue`` function.

Configuration defaults
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/kodo-wifi-broadcast.cc
   :language: c++
   :start-after: //! [5]
   :end-before: //! [6]
   :linenos:

Before continuing, you can study the various features of ns-3's `WiFi implementation
<http://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.20/models/singlehtml/index.html#
document-wifi>`_. Besides the WiFi properties, you will see a typical workflow
for setting and configuring WiFi devices in your simulation.

This part basically configures some MAC properties: disable frame fragmentation
and the RTS/CTS frame collision protocol for frames below 2200 bytes and
set the broadcast data rate to be the same as unicast for the given ``phyMode``.

WiFi PHY and Channel Helpers for Nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/kodo-wifi-broadcast.cc
   :language: c++
   :start-after: //! [6]
   :end-before: //! [7]
   :linenos:

In this part we start to build the topology for our simulation following
a typical ns-3 workflow. We start by creating the nodes that we need using
the ``NodeContainer`` class. You can create the nodes separately but this way
offers the possibility to easily assign common properties to the nodes.

We use the ``WiFiHelper`` class to set the Wifi standard.
Since we are working with DSSS, this means we need to use IEEE 802.11b.
For the physical layer, we use the ``YansWifiPhyHelper::Default()`` constructor,
and we set the pcap (packet capture) tracing format at the data link layer.
ns-3 supports different formats, here we picked the
`RadioTap <http://www.radiotap.org/>`_ format but you can choose
other format available in the helper description in its Doxygen documentation.
In a similar way, we use the ``YansWifiChannelHelper`` to create our WiFi
channel, where we set the class property named ``SetPropagationDelay`` to
``ConstantSpeedPropagationDelayModel``. This means that the delay between the
transmitter and the receiver is only determined by the distance between them.

The Wifi channel uses the ``RandomPropagationLossModel`` with a
``UniformRandomVariable`` that can be configured with the minLoss/maxLoss
parameters. Note that changing the position of the nodes has no effect on
the received signal strength. By default, 50% of the transmitted packets
will be dropped at random. You can lower the effective packet loss rate by
decreasing the minLoss parameter of the simulation.


WiFi MAC and Net Device Helpers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/kodo-wifi-broadcast.cc
   :language: c++
   :start-after: //! [7]
   :end-before: //! [8]
   :linenos:

Now that we have created the physical objects (the nodes, remember our previous
definition), we proceed to create the network interface cards (NICs, i.e. net
devices) that will communicate the different nodes. But first, we need to set
up the MAC layer. For this, we use the ``NqosWifiMacHelper`` which provides an
object factory to create instances of WiFi MACs, that do not have
802.11e/WMM-style QoS support enabled. We picked this one because we are just
interested in sending and receiving some data without QoS. By setting the type
as ``AdhocWifiMac``, we tell ns-3 that the nodes work in a decentralized way.
We also need to set the devices data rate control algorithms, which we do with
the ``WifiHelper``. This is achieved by setting the remote station manager
property to ``ConstantRateWifiManager`` for data and control packets using the
given ``phyMode``. This implies that we a fixed data rate for data and control
packet transmissions. With all the previous settings we create our (2) WiFi
cards and put them in a container by doing
``NetDeviceContainer devices = wifi.Install (wifiPhy, wifiMac, nodes);``.

Mobility Model and Helper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/kodo-wifi-broadcast.cc
   :language: c++
   :start-after: //! [8]
   :end-before: //! [9]
   :linenos:

The ns-3 ``MobilityHelper`` class assigns a model for the velocities of
the receivers within ns-3. Even though we had fixed the received power of the
decoder, it is a necessary component for the ``YansWiFiChannelHelper``. We
create a ``Vector`` describing the initial (and remaining) coordinates for both
transmitter and receiver in a 3D grid. Then, we put them in the helper with a
``ConstantPositionMobilityModel`` for the nodes.

Internet and Application Protocol Helpers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/kodo-wifi-broadcast.cc
   :language: c++
   :start-after: //! [9]
   :end-before: //! [10]
   :linenos:

After we have set up the devices and the two lowest layers, we need to set up
the network and application layer protocols. The ``InternetStackHelper``
provides functionalities for IPv4, ARP, UDP, TCP, IPv6, Neighbor Discovery, and
other related protocols. You can find more about the implementation of the
helper in this
`link <http://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.20/models/singlehtml/index.html#docu
ment-internet-models>`_. A similar process is made for the IPv4 address
assignment. We use the address range ``10.1.1.0`` with the subnet mask
``255.255.255.0``, assign it to the ``devices``.

Sockets Construction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/kodo-wifi-broadcast.cc
   :language: c++
   :start-after: //! [10]
   :end-before: //! [11]
   :linenos:

For the application protocols to work with a given data, we need a pair between
an IP address and a logical port to create a socket address for socket
communication (besides of course, the socket itself). ns-3 supports two sockets
APIs for user space applications. The first is ns-3 native, while the second
(which is based on the first) resembles more a real system POSIX-like socket
API. For further information about the differences, please refer to ns-3's
`socket implementation <http://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.20/models/singlehtml/index.html#document-network>`_.
We will focus on the ns-3 socket API variant.
The first line is meant to create the socket type from a lookup search given by
the name ``UdpSocketFactory``. It creates this type of socket on the receivers
and the transmitter. We have chosen the previous socket type in order to
represent a UDP connection that sends RLNC coded packets.

Simulation Calls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/kodo-wifi-broadcast.cc
   :language: c++
   :start-after: //! [11]
   :end-before: //! [12]
   :linenos:

We create the ``Broadcast`` object that contains the encoder and decoder
objects in our network topology.
This does not run the simulation as we will see, but it creates the
objects called by ns-3 to perform the tasks of the transmitter and receiver.

Sockets Connections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/kodo-wifi-broadcast.cc
   :language: c++
   :start-after: //! [12]
   :end-before: //! [13]
   :linenos:

Then, we create the remote and local socket addresses for binding purposes. For
the transmitter (source) we make a similar process but instead we allow
broadcasting with ``source->SetAllowBroadcast (true)`` and connect to the
broadcast address. For the receivers, we choose the default ``0.0.0.0`` address
obtained from ``Ipv4Address::GetAny ()`` and port 80 (to represent random HTTP
traffic). The receiver binds to this address for socket listening. Every time
a packet is received we trigger a callback to the reference ``&Broadcast::
ReceivePacket`` which takes the listening socket as an argument. This executes
the respective member function of the reference ``&wifiBroadcast``. This
completes our socket connection process and links the pieces for the simulation.
Finally, we populate the routing tables to ensure that we are routed inside
the topology.

Simulation Event Handler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/kodo-wifi-broadcast.cc
   :language: c++
   :start-after: //! [13]
   :end-before: //! [14]
   :linenos:

Finally, ``wifiPhy.EnablePcap ("kodo-wifi-broadcast", devices);`` allows the net
devices to create pcap files from the given devices. One file per net device.
File naming will be: ``kodo-wifi-broadcast-[NODE_ID]-[DEVICE_ID].pcap`` and the
format of these files should be the one of RadioTap and should be located on
your ``~/kodo-ns3-examples/`` folder. Later, we will review how to read those
files.

After the pcap setting, we use one of the ns-3 core features, event scheduling.
The ``Simulator`` class is inherent to ns-3 and defines how events are handled
discretely. The ``ScheduleWithContext`` member function basically tells ns-3
to schedule the ``Broadcast::SendPacket`` function every second from
the transmitter instance of ``wifiBroadcast`` and provide its arguments, e.g.
ns-3 socket pointer ``source`` and ``Time`` packet interval
``interPacketInterval``. Among the event schedulers, you will see ``Schedule``
vs. ``ScheduleWithContext``. The main difference between these two functions
is that the ``ScheduleWithContext`` tells ns-3 that the scheduled's event
context (the node identifier of the currently executed network node) belongs
to the given node. Meanwhile, ``Schedule`` may receive the context from a
previous scheduled event, which can have the context from a different node.
You can find more details about  the simulator functions in the ns-3
`event scheduling <http://www.nsnam.org/docs/manual/singlehtml/index.html#
document-events>`_ manual. With all previous descriptions, we are able to run
the simulation to see some basic effects of network coding in ns-3 with Kodo.

Simulation Runs
---------------

Now that we know each part of our setup, we will run some simulations in order
that you should know what to expect. We will run the default behavior and
change some parameters to check known results.

Default Run
^^^^^^^^^^^

First type ``cd ~/ns-3-dev`` in your terminal for you to be in the
path of your ns-3 cloned repository. Also remember that at this point,
**you need to have configured and built the project with no errors**.
If you review the constructor of the ``Broadcast`` class, you will
observe that there is a trace callback function set for the decoders.

The callback is to enable tracing in our examples, e.g. to observe how the
packets are being processed. The callback uses filters to control the
outputs that we want to observe. In the class constructor, the options
that are enabled are: (i) ``symbol_coefficients_before_read_symbol`` which
tells how are the coding coefficients of the received packet before
inserting it in the coding matrix and (ii) ``decoder_state`` which tells
how is the state of the coding coefficients matrix at the decoder after
performing Gaussian elimination.
Laer, the default run goes with 5 packets in the binary field with 2 users
and the previosuly tracing options defined.

As a starter (once located in the path described earlier), type: ::

  python waf --run kodo-wifi-broadcast

You should see an output similar to this: ::

Here we observe that every time a packet is received, the previously
mentioned information is printed for each receiver. For the
``symbol_coefficients_before_read_symbol`` output, ``C:`` indicates
that we have a received a *coded* packet with the given coding vector.
In this output, the first given coded packet (CP)
is: :math:`CP_1 = p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5`.

.. note:: Normally the encoder (based on the ``kodo_full_vector``),
   would have generated packets in a systematic way,
   but here we set that feature off in the ``Broadcast`` class constructor,
   through the encoder API ``m_encoder.set_systematic_off()``.
   So, we proceed with this example to explain the simulation, but you will
   obtain another result in your runs. However, the results obtained with
   this example apply in general.

After the input symbols have been checked, the decoder trace shows the
``decoder_state``. This is the current decoding matrix in an equivalent row
echelon form. Given that we have received :math:`p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5`,
we put them in the second row because the pivot for :math:`p_2` is
there. Also, we can argue that the pivot for :math:`p_3` is in the
third row and so on. The second received coded packet is
:math:`CP_2 = p_2 + p_3`. Notice that when we print the decoder
state again, we have changed the equation of the second and fourth rows
because with the current information we can calculate
:math:`CP_{1,new} = CP_2 = p_2 + p_3` (remember we are in modulo-2
arithmetic) and :math:`CP_{2,new} = CP_1 + CP_2 = p_4 + p_5`. Packet reception
continues until we have :math:`g` linearly independent (l.i.) coded packets.

You can also see two more types of symbols indicators. First, ``S:`` indicates
that the corresponding pivot packet has not been *seen* by the decoder. Seeing
packet :math:`k` means that we are able to compute :math:`p_k
+ \sum_{l > k} \alpha_l p_l`, i.e. to be able to compute :math:`p_k` plus a
combinations of packets of indexes greater than :math:`k`. A seen packet helps
to reduce the numbers of operations required for decoding. Second,
``?:`` indicates that the pivot of the corresponding pivot has not been
seen yet. Finally, ``U:`` indicates that the packet is uncoded, you will
see this when the complete generation is decoded.

At the end, we see that decoding was performed after 7 transmissions.
There might be two reasons for this to occur:  (i) a linearly
dependent (l.d.) coded packet was sent during the process or (ii) there
were some packet erasures during the process. From the example, we see that
during the fifth and sixth transmission, l.d. coded packets were sent, thus
conveying no new information. We will make some changes to see
more about these effects.

Changing the Field and Generation Size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Try to run the example again several times, you should see that the amount of
transmissions vary between 5 and 7, maybe sometimes a little more, due to
randomness. On average, for :math:`q = 2` you should expect that
:math:`g + 1.6` transmissions are necessary to transmit :math:`g` l.i.
packets. To verify this, we will run the examples many times to collect
this statistic. In order to not build the examples every time by using
``python waf --run kodo-wifi-broadcast``, we use a feature of ns-3
for running scripts shown
`here <https://www.nsnam.org/support/faq/running-scripts/>`_ where we
set the required environment variables. To accomplish this, we just do: ::

   python waf shell

Later, we type for testing: ::

   ./build/examples/kodo/ns3-dev-kodo-wifi-broadcast-debug

Here, if you see the regular example output, everything should have
worked fine.

.. note:: The path for the built program may change depending on
   the way ns-3 was compiled in your system. We show the resulting path
   the way we compile it by following this tutorial.

Later, you can save the following bash script as
``extra_packet_per_generation.bash`` in your ``~/ns-3-dev/`` folder:

.. code-block:: bash


  #!/bin/bash
  #Check the number of extra transmission per generation

  SUM=0
  N=$1  # Number of runs
  GENERATION_SIZE=$2  #  Generation size
  #  For-loop with range for bash to run the experiment many times
  #  and collect the total transmissions to get the average

  for (( c=1; c<=${N}; c++ ))
  do
     COMB=`./build/examples/kodo/ns3-dev-kodo-wifi-broadcast-debug | \
     grep "Total transmissions:" | cut -f5 -d\ `
     SUM=$(( ${SUM} + ${COMB} ))
  done

  EXTRA=`echo "scale= 4; (${SUM} / ${N}) - ${GENERATION_SIZE}" | bc`
  echo "Extra packets per generation: ${EXTRA}"

To set the permissions for this file, type in your terminal: ::

   chmod 755 extra_packet_per_generation.bash

This enables you and others to run and read the script, but only you
to write it. You can set this according to the needs in your system. For
further permissions, you can refer to the ``chmod`` instruction for Unix-like
systems.

The script receives two arguments: numbers of runs and generation size.
Basically it returns how much extra packets per generation were necessary for
decoding. Try to running as follows: ::

   ./extra_packet_per_generation.bash 100 5
   Extra packets per generation: 1.3600
   ./extra_packet_per_generation.bash 1000 5
   Extra packets per generation: 1.5770
   ./extra_packet_per_generation.bash 10000 5
   Extra packets per generation: 1.5823

You can see that as we increase the amount of runs, we approach to 1.6 extra
packets per generation. This is due to the linear dependency process of the
coded packets. The numbers that you get might be different, but the tendency
should be the same.

The previous result happens because we are using the binary field.
Set the field to :math:`q = 2^8` by parsing ``binary8`` in the
commandline arguments when calling ``kodo-wifi-broadcast``. To do it so,
in the line that says ``COMB`` in the bash script, include: ``--field=binary8``
after the simulation filename and rerun the script even with 100 samples.
You will see that the amount of extra packets is zero (at least with 4
decimal places). This is because it is very unlikely to receive
linearly dependent packets, even when the last coded packet is being sent.

To see the new coding coefficients for :math:`q = 2^8`, but for only a
generation size of 3 packets, type now: ::

  ./build/examples/kodo/ns3-dev-kodo-wifi-broadcast-debug --generationSize=3 --field=binary8

.. note:: If you just want to run it in the common way, you can also do it
   but for command-line parsing to change the generation size, just
   type: ``python waf --run kodo-wifi-broadcast --command-template="%s --generationSize=3 --field=binary8"``

You should see something similar to: ::

  002 U:  0 0 1

  Decoding completed! Total transmissions: 3

Notice how the size of the decoding matrix changes due to the effect of the
generation size. This is expected because the size of the decoding matrix is
given by the minimum amount of linear combinations required to decode.
Also, you can verify the coding coefficients now vary between 0 and 255
given that we have changed the field size. Try running the example with
these changes a couple of times so you can verify the above in general.

Changing the Receiver Signal Strength
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As we mentioned earlier, our WiFi PHY layer relies on constant position and
power values. We originally set up the ``rss`` value to -93 dBm to indicate our
received power. In general, the packet error rate varies with the signal
reception level, so we will adjust this. In this case, the receiver sensitivity
is -96 dBm. It means that for ``rss`` values lower than this, we will
have no packet recovery. This goes a little further from a typical erasure
channel where we may or may not have packet losses regularly, the reason being
that receiver position and power are both fixed.

To change the ``rss`` value , we can do it in the regular way as ::

  python waf --run kodo-wifi-broadcast --command-template="%s --rss=-96"

You will see no output because the program gets into an infinite loop.
To finish the program type ``Ctrl+C`` in your terminal.
To verify that the running program ended, verify that a ``^C`` sign
appears in your terminal (also ``Interrupted`` may appear as well).
The program enters a loop because we receive no
packets at all and the decoder will never be full rank.

Using Other Tracing Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So far we have seen only the decoder state in terms of rank and symbol
coefficients. In the constructor, just after, we create the decoder
instances in the ``kodo-broadcast.h`` file, you can comment the callback
and its setting in each decoder and just add the line
``decoder.set_trace_stdout ();``. With this setting you will remove all
the filters and see the full decoder trace in the simulation.
To avoid a many prints, we will use a low generation and field size with
1 user in the binary field. To do so, set the field again to ``kodo_binary``
in ``kodo-wifi-broadcast.cc`` for the field type, save your files, rebuild
and type: ::

  python waf --run kodo-wifi-broadcast --command-template="%s --generationSize=2 --users=1"

Then, you will get an output like the following: ::

  set_mutable_symbols:
  size: 2000

  Has partial symbol = 0

  Decoding completed! Total transmissions: 2

Now, we see the data in rows of 16 bytes. To the right of the
packets, you can see the converted ASCII character. In this way, you
can observe that we constantly fill the buffer with empty data,
since the example is just for showing purposes.

We first store our two raw symbols in a mutable symbol storage meaning
that its content may vary since we will perform elementary row
operations on them. The memory handling of a given symbol storage can
be in different states depending on how the memory is assigned in Kodo.
In the library we have 2 types of memory assignment for object
creation, i.e. we can create a `shallow copy or a deep copy <http://stackover
flow.com/a/184745>`_. For this implementation, we use a shallow copy by
default since it is the one that expenses the less amount of memory
by keeping to a minimum the amount of duplications.

As you can see, the process in this mode is quite verbose. We
can each detail of the decoding when a coded symbol (packet)
is read in every step. Also, we can see the state of the coding matrix
before and after each read. Similarly, we can check how is the
variation of eah pivot from one reception to another.

Finally, try disabling the decoder trace and enable the encoder trace. This
trace only has the symbol storage feature. Simply add
``m_encoder.set_trace_stdout ()`` the creation of the encoder, save,
rebuild your project and rerun the example with the previous setting,
you will only see your data in the encoder. Go back to the filters settings
and try to also add or remove some of the parameters in the filters.
For example add "symbol_data_after_read_symbol" in the filters
and verify that the output matches your expectations.

Review pcap Traces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As we described earlier, the simulation leaves pcap format files
(``kodo-wifi-broadcast-*-*.pcap``) in your ``~/ns-3-dev/`` folder.
You can read these files with different programs like tcpdump or Wireshark.
tcpdump is standard on most Unix-like systems and is based on the libpcap
library. `Wireshark <https://www.wireshark.org/>`_ is another free, open-source
packet analyzer which you can get online. Just for showing purposes we will use
tcpdump, but you can choose the one you prefer the most. For reading
both files, simply type in the respective folder: ::

  tcpdump -r kodo-wifi-broadcast-0-0.pcap -nn -tt
  tcpdump -r kodo-wifi-broadcast-1-0.pcap -nn -tt

You will get this output (it will look different on your terminal): ::

The ``0-0`` file stands for the encoder net device and ``1-0`` for the receiver
net device. There you can confirm the RadioTap format of the pcap files and
also can check other features like bit rate, frequency channel, protocol used,
rss, noise floor and the transmitter and receiver IP addresses with their
respective ports. Notice that these fit with our settings configuration.
